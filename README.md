# coinFlip

###The Ultimate Life Decider Never make a decision again!

####Part One - The Coin of Inevitability

Create a file called decider.js
Write a function called coinFlip that 'console.logs' HEADS or TAILS when called
Add a counter that declares WINNER in the console when either HEADS or TAILS is flipped 5 times.
#####Part Two - The Coin App

Create a file called decider.html
Find any coin image online
Link the .js file, while you're there you may also decide to add a .css file for some styling
Now add the necessary components to the decider.html file so that when the coin image is clicked the coinFlip function result and tally are returned somewhere on the page.

Added some extra CSS animations to show a coin spinning when clicked. Inspired by this codepen by Le Liu: https://codepen.io/le0864/pen/pbmoVQ
